What is a VPN 
Why use it 
Why Open Source (want to participate ?) 
Secure exchange between differents entities 
Better handling of the tool, made easier to use & handle such a difficult tool

NOT a VPN but the simplification of use of it : the VPN we show off is used well only if configured correctly !

Permits multpiple roadwarrior to communicate safely between each other too

Target : Small / medium-sized company or Personal home servers
Benefits : simplify industry-grade VPN management & deployment

Types of use : Roadwarrior / Site-site

Roadwarrior : allow an employee to connect to a company intranet
allow an personal user to connect from another country ( to circumvent )

Roadwarrior wants to access intranet services
Roadwarrior wants to connect directly to other roadwarriors ( "virtual" LAN )

Site-to-Site : connects two intranets or two groups of on-premises resources


post-mvp :
interception ? security tool ? surveilance ? honeypot ?
